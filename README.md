# Homework 1 - Portfolio Website Deployed on Github

The aim of this assignment was to build a professional portfolio website using HTML and CSS, following a set of specifications and a style guide. Since a portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project, I wanted to build a clean and informative portfolio showcasing my strongest work, which would hopefully lead to employment and/or more clients.

## Composition of Website

The website includes 3 html files all linking to one CSS file. The 3 pages include the index file with "About Me" information, a "Portfolio" page with project images and placeholder links to each (currently fake) project, and a "Contact" page for form submission (that currently goes nowhere).

## Process

My approach was to match the design specs from the sample screenshots as best as I could. By first creating the index html, and then starting the CSS file, I was able to go back and forth on the html and CSS to add additional divs, classes/ids or style elements to achieve what I wanted. Once the index page and the initial CSS was mostly done, it was much easier to then copy the html structure for the other pages, and add additional elements.

The process included a lot of googling, use of concepts not necessarily covered in class, trial and error, and interpretation of specs and instructions (including whether a sticky footer should stick to the bottom of a browser page or to the end of your page content). It was a good learning experience, and good way to string together concepts and activities we've covered in class so far with usage of outside sources, to manifest a "full" website. 

Some elements that were not explicitly included in the assignments but based on what I interpreted or expanded on from looking at the sample screenshots:
* Using rows/columns to align portfolio project images.
* Using linkable buttons to place a "label" on top of project images.
* Setting a different color for the project and contact page submit link.
* Small updates on the Contact form (using the color scheme in the specs) such as the text box outline color and the color and font of the text a visitor types in the textboxes.

## Deployment

Once the website was "complete", I then followed steps to update the files in Github and deploy the website for review. https://github.com/jenjch/project1PortfolioSite

## Acceptance Criteria

I hope that I have included all requested specs. Feedback on whether I followed good practices, and whether parts of my code were redundant or imprecise would be helpful.
